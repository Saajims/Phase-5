## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Collects and integrates datasets such as satellite images, land use maps, traffic data, and census information.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans, normalizes, and transforms data for analysis and modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features such as road density, green space ratio, building height, etc.
4. **Model Training**: Trains models to classify land use, predict growth trends, or suggest planning improvements.
5. **Visualization**: Generates interactive maps, heatmaps, and plots for urban insights.
6. **Deployment**: Results are integrated into an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
